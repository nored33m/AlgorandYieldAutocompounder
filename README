# Yield Farming and Auto Compounding

Yield farming is a way to earn passive 
income by providing liquidity to a 
decentralized finance platform. 

Auto compounding is a feature that 
automatically reinvests yield back 
into the same liquidity pool to 
increase growth over time. 

This repo is dedicated to the development 
of an open source auto-compounder for the
Algorand Blockchain.
