# Algorand Yield Farming Auto-Compunder

## What is a yield farmer combobulatamajig?

Yield farming is a way to earn passive 
income by providing liquidity to a 
decentralized finance platform. 

Auto compounding is a feature that 
automatically reinvests yield back 
into the same liquidity pool to 
increase growth over time.

### What will I, nored33m, be attempting to accomplish here?

This repo is dedicated to the development
of an open source auto-compounder for the
Algorand Blockchain in response to the Alogrand Hackathon.

The first step of this development will be to 
get the most basic functional version of the tool
possible running, then functionality will be added continuously.
